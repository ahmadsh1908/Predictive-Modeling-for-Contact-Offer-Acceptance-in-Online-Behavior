## Predictive-Modeling-for-Contact-Offer-Acceptance-in-Online-Behavior

# Introduction
In this project, we work with online data to gain insights into visitor intentions and optimize website purchases to maximize sales. Our goal is to personalize the contact options on the website by predicting whether a visitor will accept or reject a contact offer. The dataset contains various features related to visitor behavior and whether they accepted or rejected contact offers.

# Objectives
1. Predictive Modeling: Create a predictive model to determine whether a visitor will accept a contact offer based on their online behavior.

2. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model and provide insights into the chosen approach, features, and more.

3. Visitor Insights: Gain additional insights into what factors influence visitors to accept or reject contact offers using descriptive analytics and statistics.

4. Addressing Other Questions: Propose strategies for addressing questions related to what to offer, where to offer, and when to show the offer.

5. Business Impact: Discuss how to assess the real-world impact of the approach on business.
